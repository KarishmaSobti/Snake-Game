# Snake-Game
Snake game coded in C++
1. Introduction=
   This snake game is extremely beginner firendly and provides a great example of hands-on coding. Coded in C++ . the syntax remains pretty      simple with use of basic funtions like rand(),for loops , if-else statements , etc. This project is my first practical application of C++     and helped improve my knowledge about creating new functions and enabled me to put my skills to productive use.
2. How to play=
    This game offers a very simple control panel where:
    'a' symbolises LEFT;
    'd' symbolises RIGHT;
    'w' symbolises UP;
    's' symbolises DOWN;
    The aim is to eat the fruit symbolised by 'F' and increase the score and  the length of the snake , but as soon as the snake encounters itself,  GAMEOVER! Moreover the score is displayed at the bottom and is increased by +10 for every fruit 'F' eaten.
3. Learning=
      As stated above , this was my first hands-on coding project which tested my knowledge of rudimentary principles in C++. also ,this     project truly helped me understand coding at a deeper level by learning new syntax for example groto , enum , COORD etc.
